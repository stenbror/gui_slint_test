# A simple GUI application examp√•le in Rust with slint framework

A Rust example application that's using [Slint](https://slint.rs) for the user interface.

## About

Just me experimenting with slint GUI from Rust.

## To build and run this sample program

1. Build with cargo
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
2. Run the application binary
     ```
     cargo run
     ```

## Usage if you want to use template to build your own programs.

1. Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the ```rustc``` compiler and the ```cargo``` build system installed in your path.
2. Install [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
    ```
    cargo install cargo-generate
    ```
3. Set up a sample project with this template
    ```
    cargo generate --git https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-rust-template --name my-project
    cd my-project
    ```
3. Build with cargo
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
4. Run the application binary
     ```
     cargo run
     ```

We recommend using an IDE for development, along with our [LSP-based IDE integration for `.slint` files](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/master/tools/lsp/README.md). You can also load this project directly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install our [Slint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint).

## Next Steps

We hope that this template helps you get started and you enjoy exploring making user interfaces with Slint. To learn more
about the Slint APIs and the `.slint` markup language check out our [online documentation](https://slint.dev/docs).
